After learning how to build views with Xcode's Interface Builder, I wanted to understand how to build views programatically. 
I really enjoy how easy Xcode's Interface Builder makes it to quickly create views, but after doing some research, 
I found some very compelling arguments as to why programtic is crucial to learn, especially when working with a larger 
development team. 

The response I continued to see as to why programtic is crucial to learn was that merge conflicts can become a
disaster when using Storyboards. It makes sense. It's one gigantic file, which can easily become a mess when you 
have several devs touching it. 

This is my first view controller built programatically using PureLayout. 

Thanks to Aly Yakan for the awesome tutorial:
